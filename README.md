# JavaScript Practice – Loops & Functions (Intermediate)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **intermediate JavaScript homework** focused on:
- Loops and Iteration
- Functions

The exercises are designed to help students practice **iteration logic**, **function structure**, and **basic algorithms** using plain JavaScript.

⚠️ No array methods are allowed.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:
- Write reusable functions
- Use loops to process data
- Iterate over arrays and strings
- Build simple algorithms step by step
- Improve logical thinking using JavaScript fundamentals

---

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Run using Node.js
- No array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`)
- Allowed:
  - functions
  - loops (`for`, `while`)
  - variables and operators
  - basic conditionals (`if`)

## 🧪 Exercises

### 1️⃣ Array Length
Create a function that:
- Receives an array
- Returns the number of elements in the array

---

### 2️⃣ Print Elements with Index
Create a function that:
- Receives an array
- Prints each element with its index

---

### 3️⃣ Sum of Numbers
Create a function that:
- Receives an array of numbers
- Uses a loop to calculate the sum
- Returns the result

---

### 4️⃣ Find the Largest Number
Create a function that:
- Receives an array of numbers
- Finds and returns the largest number

---

### 5️⃣ Reverse an Array
Create a function that:
- Receives an array
- Returns a new array in reverse order
- Do not use array methods

---

### 6️⃣ Count a Value
Create a function that:
- Receives an array and a value
- Counts how many times the value appears
- Returns the count

---

### 7️⃣ String Loop
Create a function that:
- Receives a string
- Prints each character one by one using a loop

---

### 8️⃣ Pattern Printing
Create a function that:
- Receives a number `n`
- Prints the following pattern:

For `n = 4`:
```
*
**
***
****
```

## 📚 Rules
❌ No array methods  
✅ Loops and functions only  
✅ Clean and readable code  
✅ Comments are encouraged  

---

## 🚀 Bonus (Optional)
- Solve the exercises using `while` instead of `for`
- Add multiple test cases
- Try to reuse functions where possible
